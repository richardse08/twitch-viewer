# twitch-viewer
This app allows user to view information on different twitch.tv accounts

There have been a few changes to the twitch.tv API, and I have resolved to use a client ID. This is a public client ID and can be viewed in the twitch.tv documentation here: https://blog.twitch.tv/client-id-required-for-kraken-api-calls-afbb8e95f843

Update 4/21/2018
This app is not working due to Twitch's SSL cert being issued by Semantic which is now distrusted by Google
